- **Aircraft movement**
A take off, landing, or a simulated approach by an aircraft as defined in the NAV CANADA Air Control Manual of Operations (ATC MANOPS).
- **International movements**
Movements, at a Canadian airport, of aircraft arriving from or departing to a point outside Canada. International movements are subclassified inrrto "transborder" (to or from a point in the United States including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico), and "other international" (to or from points in countries other than Canada and the United States). Since aircraft movements are reported on the basis of place "arrived from" or "departed to", an arrival at Halifax airport from London, England would appear under "other international". If the same aircraft moved on to Toronto, both the departure at Halifax and the arrival at Toronto would be shown as "domestic".
- **Itinerant movements**
At airports with control towers and/or flight service stations: for the purpose of completing air traffic records, itinerant movements are considered as movements in which aircraft proceed to or arrive from another location; or where aircraft leave the circuit but return without landing at another airport. At airports without control towers: an aircraft movement in which the aircraft arrives from or departs to a point other than the reporting airport; or a movement by an aircraft that leaves the close proximity of an airport and returns without landing at another airport.
